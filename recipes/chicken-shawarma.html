    <h1>Chicken Shawarma</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish made by 
        marinating thin slices of chicken in a flavorful blend of 
        spices such as cumin, paprika, turmeric, garlic, and lemon 
        juice. The marinated meat is traditionally stacked on a 
        vertical rotisserie and slowly cooked as it rotates, allowing 
        the outer layers to become crispy while remaining tender and 
        juicy inside. Once cooked, the meat is shaved off in thin 
        slices and often served wrapped in pita bread or flatbreads 
        with accompaniments like tahini sauce, garlic sauce, fresh vegetables, and pickles.

        Shawarma can be customized with different toppings and sauces to suit 
        various tastes, and it is often enjoyed as a quick meal or part of a 
        larger spread in Middle Eastern cuisine. Its balance of spices and 
        textures offers a satisfying combination of savory, tangy, and fresh flavors.
