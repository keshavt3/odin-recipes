    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tandoori chicken is a flavorful dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, 
        characterized by its vibrant red hue and smoky aroma. The chicken is marinated 
        in a mixture of yogurt and spices, including garam masala, cumin, cayenne pepper, 
        and turmeric. Traditionally, it is cooked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven fueled 
        by charcoal or wood, which imparts a distinctive smoky flavor and achieves a high 
        cooking temperature that sears the chicken, locking in moisture.

        This dish is often served as an appetizer or main course, accompanied by naan, 
        rice, or a cooling yogurt-based raita. While the tandoor method is traditional, 
        modern adaptations include grilling or baking the chicken to replicate the high-heat 
        cooking process. Tandoori chicken's popularity has spread globally, with variations 
        like chicken tikka and chicken tikka masala emerging from this culinary tradition.
