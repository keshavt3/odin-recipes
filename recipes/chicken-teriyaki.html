    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Teriyaki chicken is a popular Japanese dish known for its sweet and savory 
        glaze made from soy sauce, mirin (a sweet rice wine), sugar, and sometimes 
        sake. The chicken is typically grilled, pan-fried, or broiled until it's 
        tender and slightly caramelized, then coated or simmered in the teriyaki 
        sauce until glossy and flavorful. The sauce’s balance of saltiness and 
        sweetness gives the dish its signature rich umami taste.

        This dish is often served sliced over a bed of steamed white rice 
        and accompanied by vegetables like broccoli or carrots. 
        While traditionally made with chicken thighs for extra 
        juiciness, many variations use chicken breasts as well. 
        Teriyaki chicken is both comforting and accessible, making 
        it a favorite in Japanese restaurants and home kitchens worldwide.

    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce (preferably low sodium)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sake (optional, or use water)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger (optional)</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice (for serving)</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds and chopped green onions (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, mirin, sake (or water), and sugar. Add grated ginger and minced garlic if using. Stir until sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Prepare the chicken: Pat chicken dry and lightly season with salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken: Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place chicken skin-side down (if using skin-on) and cook until browned, about 5–7 minutes per side, depending on thickness.</li>
        <li>Add sauce: Pour the teriyaki sauce mixture into the pan with the chicken. Let it simmer and bubble gently, turning the chicken to coat it as the sauce thickens and glazes.</li>
        <li>Finish: Once the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is glossy and thick, remove from heat. Let rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve: Slice the chicken and serve over rice. Drizzle with extra sauce and garnish with sesame seeds and green onions if desired.</li>
    </ol>
